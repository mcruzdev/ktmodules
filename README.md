# KtModules

An simple application divided in modules.

## Goal

The main goal of this application is to present a modularized application with Spring Boot, Kotlin and Gradle with Kotlin.

### Application plugin

A SpringBoot application allow us to execute an embedded server like Tomcat, Undertow, Jetty, etc.
Combining with the `bootJar` plugin it is a great way to execute a Web Server with `java -jar`command.
